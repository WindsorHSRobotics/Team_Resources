# Team Resources

## Repository for the Windsor High School First Tech Challenge Robotics Team
---
Our robotics program is all about learning.  Whether you are taking <i>Introduction to Robotics</i> class or if you are the systems engineer for your competitive FTC team, there is plenty to learn to help you get ready for college engineering and computer science.  Use this repository to help grow your knowledge and skills in robotics.  These examples offer a wide variety of valuable tools, code, media and text resosurces.

### Learning the Game

There are many web sources out there that will help you learn how to compete in FTC.  The best of those are listed below.  Some are official FTC resources.  Others have been built by collaborations of teams or support organizations.

- [Offficial FTC Game and Season Materials](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/game-and-season-info) (Start here.  Rules, animations, scoring, etc. are all found here.)
- [Game Manual Zero](https://gm0.org/en/latest/) (There is so much here to help with strategy and just a general understanding of the game.)
- [REV Robotics FTC Tech Tips](https://docs.revrobotics.com/docs/first-tech-challenge) (Some of these links are for last year's competition as of now but REV has some excellent tutorials.)
- [REV Robotics YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/revrobotics) (These guys just do great work.  Pleanty to watch.)

### Learning to Code

- [Training Mod by Graden Gentry](https://github.com/GramGra07/WHS-FTC-GramGra07-Code_Training_Mod) (Use this excellent guide created by our own Graden Gentry to begin learning to code.)
- [Android Studio Programming](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/android-studio-guide.pdf) (We only use Android Studio for programming.  This document explains how to get started.)
- [Current FTC Controller Repository](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) (8.2 - 7/11/23)
- [Installing FIRST Tech Challenge Apps Without Google Play](http://firsttechchallenge.blogspot.com/2021/02/installing-ftc-apps-without-google-play.html) (New since ladt year, we are not using the Play Store any more with Android phones.)
