### Engineering Portfolio - What Do the Judges Want?

What are judges looking for when they review an FTC team’s Engineering Portfolio? Most importantly, judges look for evidence that meets award criteria.

Make the judges’ jobs easy. Organize the team’s portfolio to focus on the awards. Use keywords from the award titles such as control, design, promoting our team, and inspiring others. Also, include a roadmap such as a table of contents, headnotes, and headings that make finding your team’s qualifications for an award simple to locate. The portfolio should be easy to read, well organized, and attractive.

While the format and ease of navigating your portfolio are important, the judges know that content is king. Judges will rely on the Engineering Portfolio’s quality to decide who wins the Think Award. Game Manual Part 1 lists the requirements for the awards. The portfolio should cover examples and narrative to cover the Think Award or any other award the team seeks to earn.
